We have created the plugin that removes all technical limitations and turns the monetization of a website from the endless and killing routine into a creative process. The plugin provides many options for targeting the advertisements and allows to output unlimited number of ad units in different places (for example inside an article after 5 paragraph or after the first image in the text). It is perfect for conducting an A/B test (not only for advertisement, but also for headings, different texts, etc.).

There are a lot of possibilities, use them and earn on your website the maximum profit! You don’t have excuses any more that would justify missing hundreds or even thousands of dollars every month just because you haven’t set up the advertisement yet.
